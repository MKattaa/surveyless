Welcome to `surveyless`! This is a guided survey demo that will showcase important features in `surveyless` Before we proceed with more questions, let's take a quick tour on navigational features when taking the survey:

- Click on the logo/header to head back to the survey home page.
- Use the arrow keys ⬅️➡️ to navigate through survey questions. You can only go to the next question if you have answered the current question.
- You can also navigate and track the progress of answered and unanswered questions using the progress bar component (located at the bottom of the screen).

`surveyless` saves your progress locally, so you can continue where you left off.

In case you were wondering, this section was written in markdown. In the next question, we will ask for your feedback on the common markdown features that are supported in `surveyless`!
