All questions in `surveyless` can be supplemented with an `additionalComments` section. Simply turn it on in the frontmatter of the markdown, and you can collect additional open-ended comments for the question.

This is a useful feature if you want to collect additional data to learn more about the question. It is also common to include additional comments in single-choice or multi-choice questions as a catch-all for answer choices that might have been left out.
