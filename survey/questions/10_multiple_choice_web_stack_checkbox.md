`surveyless` provides the button and checkbox layout for rendering choice sets for multi-choice questions. Both horizontal and vertical layouts are supported. This question presents the layout with vertical buttons, and is less ideal than the horizontal checkbox presentation in the previous question. When there are a lot of answer choices, it is usually more concise to place them in a horizontal layout.
